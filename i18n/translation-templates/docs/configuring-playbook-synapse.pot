Load-balancing was done based on the requestor's IP address. This is simple, but not necessarily optimal. If you're accessing your account from multiple IP addresses (e.g. your mobile phone being on a different network than your PC), these separate requests may potentially be routed to different workers, each of which would need to cache roughly the same data."
