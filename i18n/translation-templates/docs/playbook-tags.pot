msgid "Here are some playbook tags that you should be familiar with:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/playbook-tags.md:18
msgid "`setup-all` — runs all setup tasks (installation and uninstallation) for all components, but does not start/restart services"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/playbook-tags.md:20
msgid "`install-all` — like `setup-all`, but skips uninstallation tasks. Useful for maintaining your setup quickly when its components remain unchanged. If you adjust your `vars.yml` to remove components, you'd need to run `setup-all` though, or these components will still remain installed"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/playbook-tags.md:22
msgid "`setup-SERVICE` (e.g. `setup-postmoogle`) — runs the setup tasks only for a given role, but does not start/restart services. You can discover these additional tags in each role (`roles/**/tasks/main.yml`). Running per-component setup tasks is **not recommended**, as components sometimes depend on each other and running just the setup tasks for a given component may not be enough. For example, setting up the [mautrix-telegram bridge](configuring-playbook-bridge-mautrix-telegram.md), in addition to the `setup-mautrix-telegram` tag, requires database changes (the `setup-postgres` tag) as well as reverse-proxy changes (the `setup-nginx-proxy` tag)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/playbook-tags.md:24
msgid "`install-SERVICE` (e.g. `install-postmoogle`) — like `setup-SERVICE`, but skips uninstallation tasks. See `install-all` above for additional information."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/playbook-tags.md:26
msgid "`start` — starts all systemd services and makes them start automatically in the future"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/playbook-tags.md:28
msgid "`stop` — stops all systemd services"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/playbook-tags.md:30
msgid "`ensure-matrix-users-created` or its alias `ensure-users-created` — a special tag which ensures that all special users needed by the playbook (for bots, etc.) are created. See the variable `matrix_user_creator_users_auto` on [`group_vars/matrix_servers`](../group_vars/matrix_servers) for actual values of users which running this tag can create by default."

#: ../../../docs/playbook-tags.md:33
msgid "`setup-*` tags and `install-*` tags **do not start services** automatically, because you may wish to do things before starting services, such as importing a database dump, restoring data from another server, etc."

msgid "Please be careful not to confuse the playbook tags with the `just` shortcut commands (\"recipes\"). For details about `just` commands, see: [Running `just` commands](just.md)"
